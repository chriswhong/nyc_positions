nyc_positions
=============

Scraper for NYC full-time employee position data from the Supporting Schedules Budget Docs

Start with the [Supporting Schedules FY15 Budget PDF](http://www.nyc.gov/html/omb/downloads/pdf/ss6_14.pdf)

Since it's locked, use something like Apple Preview to print/export it to another PDF (the output PDF will not be locked)

Use pdftotxt to convert it to a txt file

```
>pdftotxt -layout supportingSchedules.pdf
```
